//This is the first project 

Yeah could have been made in a little more efficent way but time was a constraint so!!!

#Screens

#Context provides common shared data using context api

#Used useState hook for setting ids

#Navigation main source in App.jsx

#And main.jsx is the render method

#data.js is the data file to mimican api data
